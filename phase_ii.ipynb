    "### Problem Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Video games are becoming more and more popular by the day, with releases become instant hits and others slowly rising in popularity as it gains an audience. For games that become popular right off the bat, how do they retain their popularity? Is it because of their genre? Their length? There are many factors to a game's success, but there are even more related to how a game maintains its popularity, as that is a much harder struggle than the initial popularity of the game. Now, there are plenty of outliers to this. For example, games like Madden NFL, NBA 2K, FC, have a cult following due to their respective sports that massively contributes to their popularity. On the other hand, there are plenty of games that are completely imagined that have nothing to do with real life yet still have a massive, dedicated following for years. Think games like Overwatch, with no semblance to reality yet still massively popular. This is what I aim to figure out. The key questions are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are there any particular markers or trends that go towards a game being popular? \n",
    "2. Say a game is popular on release, are there any marker or trends showing this game retaining its popularity? \n",
    "3. How do such markers or trends change when differing certain charecteristics of the game (genre, year of release, country of origin)?\n",
    "4. How can we predict, overall, if a game will start off popular and retain its popularity? On the same line, are there any markers or trends that are consistent with how long a game retains its popularity? If so, how can we use these markers to guage similar games and their popularity retention scores?\n",

    "In this section we will talk about which API we will use, how we did it, etc. Then, once that part about actually gathering the data is over, we move on to cleaning it. What did we clean, how did we clean it, and how did the overall process go. Finally, we talk about the formatting and visualization of the data. Talk about what exactly we analyzed, how we analyzed it, and what visualizations we used. Talk about what specific plotting libraries we used (seaport, madplotlib, plotly, whatever). Then how our data solved each question, this will be BROAD, since we will actually answer the questions later."
